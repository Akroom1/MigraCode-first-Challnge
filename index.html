      <p>
        For 2,000 years, <span>the Gothic Quarter</span> has been the spiritual and secular
        center of the city. Relics of ancient Roman buildings are still found
        here, but the Middle Ages are best represented by the historic monuments
        packed into this quarter.

      <p>
        In the Eixample district off the elegant boulevard of Passeig de Gràcia,
        the UNESCO-listed  <span>Casa Milà</span> is Antoni Gaudí's most famous secular
        building. Casa Milà is also affectionately known as "La Pedrera," which
        translates to "The Stone Quarry" because the building resembles an open
        quarry.
